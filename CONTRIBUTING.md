## Build the Examples

Make sure you do a dual platform build for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` via:

```
# Ensure docker builder with multi platform support
docker buildx create \                                                                                                                              
  --name container \
  --driver=docker-container

# Build & push image
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . -t ghcr.io/loft-sh/vcluster-plugin-example:v2 --builder container --push
```
